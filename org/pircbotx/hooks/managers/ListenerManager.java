/**
 * Manages everything about Listeners: adding, removing, and dispatching events
 * to appropriate listeners.
 * <p>
 * An important job of all methods in this class is to absorb and report <u>any</u>
 * exceptions or errors before they reach {@link PircBotX}. Failure to do so
 * could break many internal long running operations. It is therefor recommended
 * to catch {@link Throwable} and report with {@link PircBotX#logException(java.lang.Throwable) }
 * <p>
 * Performance is another important job in implementations. Events can be dispatched
 * very quickly at times (eg a /WHO on all joined channels) so lots of expensive
 * calls can hurt performance of the entire bot. Therefor important methods like
 * {@link #dispatchEvent(org.pircbotx.hooks.Event) } should be as fast as possible
